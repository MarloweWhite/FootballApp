# FootballApp
App to visit all the stadiums in the UK.

Navigate to the Branch Dev2 for the most up to date version

In this project we were tasked to make a football app that would allow a fan to track their visiting of all the stadiums in the UK

In this project I contributed by adding the Navigation bar and the icons, the transitioning between activities which i later planned to convert to fragments to improve UX however due to time constraints and various hurdles was unable to complete in time however progress made is in the fragments branch. Along with this I added in an information button to the drawer for the stadiums which i was unable to merge in time however this code is in the Icon branch. I also set up the admobs and then put in various data into the json
files for the leagues.

In this process we had to do weekly sprint meetings and used Taiga to track task progress and git for version control.
