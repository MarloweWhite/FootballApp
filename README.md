# FootballApp
App to visit all the stadiums in the UK
In this project we were tasked to make a football app that would allow a fan to track their visiting of all the stadiums in the UK

In this project I contributed by adding the Navigation bar and the icons, the transitioning between activities which i later planned to convert to fragments to improve
UX however due to time constraints and various hurdles was unable to complete in time however progress made will be posted. Along with this I added in an information button
to the drawer for the stadiums which i was unable to merge in time however this will also be posted. I also set up the admobs and then put in various data into the json
files for the leagues.

In this process we had to do weekly sprint meetings and used Taiga to track task progress and git for version control.
